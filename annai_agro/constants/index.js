However, the industry often prioritizes visual aesthetics over biochemical potency. To secure a safe and effective supply chain, buyers must look beyond the 'Golden' appearance and focus on verifiable laboratory parameters like Curcumin concentration and Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs).",

In reality, a bright exterior can often be a mask for adulteration with agents like Lead Chromate or Metanil Yellow. True quality is dictated by the Curcuminoid content, typically ranging from 2.5% to 5.5% in premium Indian varieties like Salem and Erode.
